# HP3-SplitScreen

Split-screen multiplayer for **Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban** (PC, EA/KnowWonder 2004).

The retail game runs on Unreal Engine 2 with **every trace of split-screen support stripped out** — `SplitScreen`, `AddPlayer`, `RemovePlayer` and all joystick-axis symbols are missing from the shipped binaries, and the UnrealScript compiler is unreachable. This mod puts it back **without recompiling a single line of the game and without modifying any game file**.

A proxy `d3d8.dll` loads alongside the game, hooks the renderer, and drives the engine's own `UCanvas::DrawPortal` once per player. Each player gets an equal vertical strip following a different character; players 2..N are directly controllable with their own keyboard or gamepad.

## Features

- **N-player vertical split** — `Players=N` in `hp3mod.ini` produces N strips (2 and 3 verified; the view count is data, not code)
- **Player 2 (and 3) fully controllable**: walk, turn, jump, cast real spells, use/interact
- **Distinct characters per view** (Harry / Hermione / Ron), each with their own camera, floor and collision
- Real spellcasting through the game's own script VM (Rictusempra, Depulso, Lumos, ... ) with hold-to-aim and vertical aim
- Camera that slides against walls instead of clipping, gamepad camera-follow + orbit (v13+)
- Works on free-roam levels; survives level changes

## Install

1. Copy `bin/d3d8.dll` and `bin/hp3mod.ini` into the game's `system\` folder, next to `hppoa.exe`.
2. Run the game normally. No launcher, no patches, nothing else.

Windows loads a DLL from the application directory before the one in `System32`, so that is the whole install. Uninstall = delete the two files (plus `hp3mod.log` if present).

> Check the build: open `system\hp3mod.log` — line 2 must say `build v47`.

## Player 2 controls

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `T` / `G` | walk forward / back |
| `F` / `H` (or `Q`/`E`) | turn left / right |
| `R` | jump |
| `Y` | cast spell (hold to aim, release to fire) |
| `V` | use / interact |

The numpad mirrors the same actions (NumLock ON), and XInput gamepads (Xbox/DualSense) are supported: left stick walks/turns, right stick is the camera-follow/orbit + vertical spell aim. Full details in `docs/MANUAL.txt`.

## Building from source

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install g++-mingw-w64-i686
./build.sh          # -> dist/d3d8.dll
```

Any 32-bit MinGW-w64 toolchain works; the source is a single translation unit (`src/dllmain.cpp`) with an export table (`src/d3d8.def`). Runtime configuration lives in `src/hp3mod.ini` — the in-code fallbacks deliberately match the shipped defaults.

### GitHub Actions release build

A preconfigured workflow (`.github/workflows/build-release.yml`) builds the same DLL and bundles the default `hp3mod.ini` into a GitHub release. To use it:

1. Open the **Actions** tab in the repository.
2. Select **Build release** in the left sidebar.
3. Click **Run workflow**.
4. Optionally enter a release **tag** and **title**, then run the job. Leave the tag blank to auto-generate a unique one (for example `v47-20260906-1234567890`).

The workflow compiles the DLL natively on a Windows runner using MSYS2's 32-bit MinGW-w64 toolchain (`mingw-w64-i686-gcc`), attaches both the `.zip` and the individual `d3d8.dll` / `hp3mod.ini`, and also uploads them as run artifacts.

## Version history (short form)

- **v13** jump / physics pin proven on hardware
- **v23** ProcessEvent telemetry — the engine can be watched thinking
- **v37** per-event timeline logging; the post-cast hop named in the log
- **v39–v43** cast-exit storm swallow, animation re-sync, ground physics hold
- **v44** settle radius 350 + standing yaw lock (hardware-confirmed)
- **v45** first hardening attempt — regressed on hardware, pulled
- **v47** the post-cast animation re-sync rebuilt event-driven: it arms once at the cast state's own exit event and executes only when nothing new (player or mod) has started acting on the pawn — a re-sync can no longer interrupt a cast no matter how fast you chain them
